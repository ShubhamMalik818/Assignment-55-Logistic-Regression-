    "\n",
    "1. Linear regression: Linear regression is a statistical model that predicts a continuous value based on a set of independent variables. The model is \n",
    "                      a line, and the independent variables are used to estimate the slope and intercept of the line.\n",
    "2. Logistic regression: Logistic regression is a statistical model that predicts a categorical value based on a set of independent variables. The \n",
    "                        model is a logistic function, and the independent variables are used to estimate the parameters of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the two models is that linear regression predicts a continuous value, while logistic regression predicts a \n",
    "categorical value.\n",

    "Logistic regression could be used to predict whether or not a patient has cancer based on their symptoms, medical history, and test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, logistic regression is more appropriate when the dependent variable is categorical. This is because the logistic function is a more \n",
    "flexible model than the linear function. The logistic function can take on a variety of shapes, which allows it to fit a wider range of data.\n",
